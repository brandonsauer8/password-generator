This is a password generator that will ask you 5 different questions:

1. Asks the user how many characters between 8 and 128 they would like to use for their password.

2. Does the user want to use lower case letters?

3. Does the user want to use upper case letters?

4. Does the user want to use numbers?

5. Does the user want to use special characters?

It will then randomize each of the selectors and generate a random password.
